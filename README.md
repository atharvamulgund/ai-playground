# AI Playground - React + TensorFlow\.js

Welcome to the **AI Playground** repository! This project demonstrates how to use **React** with **TensorFlow\.js** for real-time emotion detection and doodle recognition. Both of these are implemented using machine learning models running directly in the browser.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains two main projects:

1. **Emotion Detection**: A real-time emotion detection tool that uses TensorFlow\.js to classify emotions based on user input via webcam.
2. **Doodle Classifier (Air Draw)**: A tool that recognizes and classifies doodles drawn by users in the browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. You can download and install them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atharvamulgund/ai-playground.git
   cd ai-playground
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application locally:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the app in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).

### üåê Deploying

For deploying to a hosting service like Firebase or Netlify, follow the instructions in the respective deployment guides:

* **Firebase Hosting**: [Firebase Hosting Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)
* **Netlify**: [Netlify Docs](https://docs.netlify.com/)

## üîß Features

* **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Using TensorFlow\.js, this feature captures emotions in real-time via webcam.
* **Doodle Classification (Air Draw)**: This feature allows users to draw simple doodles, which are classified by a TensorFlow\.js model.
